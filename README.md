# Reverse an Array
The `Reverse an Array` is a strategy to reverse the array
```
Input : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output : [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## Challenge
Write a function called `reverseArray` which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the `built-in` methods available to your language, return an array with elements in `reversed order`.

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach used to reverse an array is called `two pointer approach`.
```
Time Complexity : _Linear - O(n)_
Space Complexity : _Constant - O(1)_
```
